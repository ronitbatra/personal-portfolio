Hi, I'm Ronit! 

## CURRENTLY

I'm a third year @ UVA studying computer science and economics. I love playing basketball, hiking, djing, and listening to music. I have previous experience working @ Golden Ventures, Edtrax, and another Startup backed by tier 1 investors. I work on applied AI and GTM, and independently explore interfaces for data and ML systems. How can we ship useful AI products that feel fast and reliable?


## FUTURE

I like building things at the intersection of AI and data — from predicting economic indicators and designing trading strategies to experimenting with neural nets and voice-powered apps. What drives me is applying AI and agentic techniques to real-world problems, not just toy demos. Data is always the backbone, whether it’s optimizing markets, modeling prices, or shaping better human–AI interactions. At the end of the day, I’m focused on turning ideas into systems that are practical, creative, and actually useful.


## REACH OUT

I’m always looking to collaborate on ideas that move the world forward. If you find anything I'm working on interesting or you're just passionate about the problem you're solving, I'd love to chat.
